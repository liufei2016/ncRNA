# News
<br>2019-08-20 The first version of ncRNA was released.
<br>2021-08-18 A stable version of ncRNA was finished and internally used.
<br>2021-08-31 A stable version of ncRNA was released for public use.
<br>2022-04-11 An update with function increase and UI upgrade of ncRNA was released. Bugs fixed and 4K resolution adaptation.
<br>2022-10-25 An patch to fix crash problem was updated.

# Background and Introduction
The purpose of this tool is to provide users with the construction of non-coding RNA networks and then the simulation and analysis of non-coding RNA networks, mainly including two main functions: 

1. non-coding RNA modeling and visualization
2. dynamic model management and viewing

<br>Among them, non-coding RNA modeling and visualization is based on those nodes and lines that users use when drawing and modeling, then generate xml type files.
<br>Dynamic model management and viewing refers to saving and managing models through input information in the software.
<br>This software provides biomolecular modeling and simulation functions for researchers in the field of systems biology.

# Features
- Features overviews
   - User-friendly non-coding RNA icon, Protein icon, cell icon, etc. 
   - Easy to build a strong non-coding RNA network. 
   - Rich choices of custom options in modeling ncRNA network.
   - Formal analysis based on graph theory. 
   - Export non-coding RNA network models to various file formats.
   - Link non-coding RNA to Kinetic model based on Snoopy.
   - Easy connection to external non-coding RNA database an GO analysis.
