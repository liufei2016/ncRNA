# Background and Introduction
The purpose of this system is to provide users with the construction of non-coding RNA to complete the simulation of non-coding RNA, mainly including two main functions: 
Operating environment:(1) non-coding RNA modeling and visualization
<br>(2) dynamic model management and viewing
<br>Among them, non-coding RNA modeling and visualization is based on those nodes and lines that users use when drawing and modeling, then generate xml type files.
<br>Dynamic model management and viewing refers to saving and managing models through input information in the software. 
<br>This software provides biomolecular modeling and simulation functions for researchers in the field of systems biology
# Features
- Features overviews
   - User-friendly non-coding RNA icon, Protein icon, cell icon, etc. 
   - Easy to build a strong non-coding RNA network. 
   - Formal analysis based on graph theory. 
   - Link non-coding RNA to Kinetic model based on Snoopy.
# Download and Get Started
- Operating environment:
<br>The software is developed with C++ and QT in the Windows operational systems. 
<br>We encourage you to use the tool in the Windows environment as it has been performed strict testing in this environment. We welcome any use suggestions and comments in different operational systems.
