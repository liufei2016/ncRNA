# ncRNA insight 
- a tool for modeling, visualizing and analyzing ncRNA networks
# Manual       
Manual can be found at [Manual.pdf](https://github.com/liufei2016/ncRNA/blob/master/Manual.pdf). The examples in the manual can be downloaded from Examples, which include:
- model construction
The tool provides specific graphical elements of species, edges, and metadata for easy representation of ncRNA network.
<br>According to their categories,species include ncRNAs, genes and proteins, and ncRNAs are further organized.
<br>Edges are divided into undirected, unidirectional, bidirectional and inhibitor types.Metadata includes comments, cell images and cell parts images. 
<br>These graphic elements help to build a powerful and friendly ncRNA network.
<br>The tool allows you to graphically create ncRNA networks by simply dragging specific graphical elements of species, connect to the palette, and then connect them with appropriate edges.Each element has some attributes, such as name, type, contained genes, and graphic attributes.
<br>The tool also allows appropriate containers (such as pictures of batteries or components) to be connected to constructed ncRNA network.Therefore, the constructed network can be friendly, layered and large-scale.
<br>It also supports clicking the icon and selecting "external link" to check the information about relevant information of ncRNA such as "ncRNA center", "NCBI", "gene ontology", "KEGG pathway" and "NCBI structure".
- static analysis
The tool provides several analysis techniques for ncRNA networks, which can be summarized as follows.
   - basic analysis
   The tool allows you to highlight adjacent species by right clicking the species icon and selecting "Find neighours", and you can also generate subnetworks containing interesting ncRNAs by right clicking its icon and selecting "generate subnetworkrock".
   <br>This helps to examine ncRNA information from different sources.
   - network analysis
   - degree analysis
   - go analysis via agrigo or metascape
- dynamic analysis
# News
<br>2021-08-20 New Windows stable version of ncRNA is released.
<br>2021-08-18 The first version of ncRNA is finished and internally used.

# Background and Introduction
The purpose of this system is to provide users with the construction of non-coding RNA to complete the simulation of non-coding RNA, mainly including two main functions: 
Operating environment:(1) non-coding RNA modeling and visualization
<br>(2) dynamic model management and viewing
<br>Among them, non-coding RNA modeling and visualization is based on those nodes and lines that users use when drawing and modeling, then generate xml type files.
<br>Dynamic model management and viewing refers to saving and managing models through input information in the software. 
<br>This software provides biomolecular modeling and simulation functions for researchers in the field of systems biology
# Features
- Features overviews
   - User-friendly non-coding RNA icon, Protein icon, cell icon, etc. 
   - Easy to build a strong non-coding RNA network. 
   - Formal analysis based on graph theory. 
   - Link non-coding RNA to Kinetic model based on Snoopy.
# Download and Get Started
- Operating environment:
<br>The software is developed with C++ and QT in the Windows operational systems. 
<br>We encourage you to use the tool in the Windows environment as it has been performed strict testing in this environment. We welcome any use suggestions and comments in different operational systems.
