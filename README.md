# Background and Introduction
The purpose of this system is to provide users with the construction of non-coding RNA to complete the simulation of non-coding RNA, mainly including two main functions: 
<br>(1) non-coding RNA modeling and visualization
<br>(2) dynamic model management and viewing
<br>Among them, non-coding RNA modeling and visualization is based on those nodes and lines that users use when drawing and modeling, then generate xml type files.
<br>Dynamic model management and viewing refers to saving and managing models through input information in the software. 
<br>This software provides biomolecular modeling and simulation functions for researchers in the field of systems biology
